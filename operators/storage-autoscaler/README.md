# Storage Autoscaler Operator

Kubernetes controller that watches PVC usage via kubelet metrics (scraped by Prometheus) and automatically expands PersistentVolumeClaims when usage exceeds a configurable threshold. This prevents storage-related outages by proactively resizing volumes before they fill up.

> **Note**: Throughout this document, `<DOMAIN>` refers to the root domain
> configured in `scripts/.env` (e.g., `example.com`).

## How It Works

1. A `VolumeAutoscaler` custom resource targets one or more PVCs (by name or label selector)
2. The controller polls Prometheus for `kubelet_volume_stats_used_bytes` and `kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes`
3. When usage exceeds the configured threshold (default 80%), the controller patches the PVC to increase its size
4. Safety checks enforce cooldown periods, maximum size caps, StorageClass expandability, and volume health before expanding
5. Inode usage can optionally be monitored via `kubelet_volume_stats_inodes_used` / `kubelet_volume_stats_inodes`

## Controller-Aware Expansion (v0.3.0)

In environments where the CSI driver requires volumes to be offline before expansion (such as Harvester/Longhorn), patching a PVC directly gets stuck because the volume cannot be detached while the owning controller keeps the pod running. The `controllerRef` field solves this by delegating the resize to the managing controller instead of patching the PVC.

When `controllerRef` is set, the storage-autoscaler patches the controller's storage spec (e.g., a CNPG `Cluster` object's `spec.storage.size`) rather than the PVC itself. The controller then orchestrates an orderly rolling resize — draining replicas, detaching volumes, expanding, and reattaching — without any manual intervention.

### Example: CNPG-Aware VolumeAutoscaler

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.volume-autoscaler.io/v1
kind: VolumeAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: gitlab-cnpg-data
  namespace: gitlab
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      cnpg.io/cluster: gitlab-cnpg
  threshold: 80
  increaseBy: 20
  maxSize: 500Gi
  controllerRef:
    apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
    kind: Cluster
    name: gitlab-cnpg
    storagePath: spec.storage.size
```

With this configuration, when the monitored PVC exceeds 80% usage the controller patches `gitlab-cnpg` Cluster's `spec.storage.size`. CNPG then performs a safe online resize across all replicas.

## Prometheus Metrics Exported

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `volume_autoscaler_scale_events_total` | Counter | `namespace`, `pvc`, `volumeautoscaler` | Total number of PVC expansion events |
| `volume_autoscaler_pvc_usage_percent` | Gauge | `namespace`, `pvc`, `volumeautoscaler` | Current usage percentage of managed PVCs |
| `volume_autoscaler_poll_errors_total` | Counter | `namespace`, `volumeautoscaler`, `reason` | Total number of poll errors |
| `volume_autoscaler_reconcile_duration_seconds` | Histogram | (none) | Duration of reconcile loops in seconds |

Metrics are served on `:8080` and scraped via the `prometheus.io/scrape` pod annotation.

## Deployment

The storage-autoscaler is deployed in **Phase 3** of `deploy-cluster.sh`. Kubernetes manifests live in `services/storage-autoscaler/` and include:

- `deployment.yaml` -- 3-replica Deployment with leader election, pinned to `workload-type: general` nodes
- RBAC resources (ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding)
- `VolumeAutoscaler` CR instances for cluster PVCs

For airgapped clusters, a pre-built image tarball is available at `operators/images/storage-autoscaler-v0.3.0-amd64.tar.gz`.

## Prerequisites

- Go version 1.25.7
- Docker 17.03+
- kubectl v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus deployed

## Build

```bash
# Build and push Docker image to GHCR (multi-arch)
make docker-buildx IMG=ghcr.io/derhornspieler/rke2-cluster/storage-autoscaler:v0.3.0

# Or build for local/airgapped deployment (amd64 only, saves tarball)
make docker-save IMG=harbor.<DOMAIN>/library/storage-autoscaler:v0.3.0
```

## Grafana Dashboard

The **"Storage & PV Usage"** Grafana dashboard visualizes PVC usage percentages, scale events, poll errors, and reconcile duration using the metrics exported by this operator.
